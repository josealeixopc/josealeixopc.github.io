## Who am I?

I'm a 21-year-old Computer Science Masters student at [Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto](https://fe.up.pt). I enjoy programming as much as going for a run. Not being ironic. I actually like running. Yes, there are [dozens of us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKie-vgUGdI)!

## What do I do?

Besides breathing every once in a while, I have knowledge in several programming languages, such as Java, C/C++, HTML&CSS and a little bit of Python (I'm working on it, okay?). I'm Portuguese, but also speak English (as you may have noticed) and ein bisschen Deutsch, having taken a whole year of German classes.

You can see some of my university and personal projects at [@jazzchipc](https://github.com/jazzchipc) and check my [resume](/assets/doc/Jos√© Aleixo-Europass-EN.pdf).
