<a id="who-am-i" class="anchor" href="#who-am-i" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who am I?</h3>

<p>I'm currently a somewhat normal human being, with 21 years of existence. I'm quite fond of programming and computers in general. I like to think I have great taste in music and clothing. Oh, I also run... like a lot. </p>

<a id="what-do-i-do" class="anchor" href="#what-do-i-do" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What do I do?</h3>

<p>Besides breathing every once in a while, I have knowledge in several programming languages, such as Java, C/C++, HTML&amp;CSS, C#, JavaScript, Prolog and a little bit of Python (I'm working on it, okay?). I've done web projects in frameworks like Express.js, Vue.js, Angular.js and ASP.NET. I've also created a few apps for Android.
  
<p>I'm Portuguese, but also speak English (as you may have noticed) and ein bisschen Deutsch, having taken a whole year of German classes.</p>

<p>You can see some of my university and personal projects at <a href="https://github.com/jazzchipc" class="user-mention">@jazzchipc</a> and check my <a href="JoséAleixo-Europass-EN.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
